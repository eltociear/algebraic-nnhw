Additional Python packages and scripts used in this project that the author created for general development utilities and aids, including:
  - A custom Python debugger that lists relevant variables in backtraces and the surrounding source code/method/Class/source file where the error occurred.
  - A logging utility that automatically lists the name of the variable being printed and the method/Class name in which the print statement is written for providing context in the log.
  - A general tree data structure called `sections` containing a convenient API and useful text representations when being printed for helping to easily visualize the data structure.
